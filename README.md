Hi everyone! I'm Xasan, also known as Xasan Designer. I'm a student at Hormuud University in Somalia, and I'm passionate about web and mobile app development.  I'm currently learning full-stack development, which means I'm working on both the front-end (what users see) and back-end (the behind-the-scenes logic) of websites and applications. I'm also exploring mobile app development.

I'm eager to collaborate on projects, so if you have an idea you'd like to discuss, please feel free to reach out!  Let's build something amazing together.
